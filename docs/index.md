# What do you think about these robots?

We are interested in investigating how you interpret these robots! This study looks at two different artificially intelligent algorithms being employed in robots. For both, you will watch a clip of the robots learning how to interact with their environment, and then one of them actually using what they learned to interact with the environment. The robot will try to learn the best way to move as much as possible without getting too close to any other objects. As you can see they are not very good at doing this but are slowly learning how to get better at it. 

Below there are four videos please fill out your responses in the survey below each video. Thanks for participating! (Please note this survey is completely confidential.)
